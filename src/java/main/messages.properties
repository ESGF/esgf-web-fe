esgf.homepage.about=The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) was established in 1989 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), located in the San Francisco Bay area. \
Our staff includes research scientists, computer scientists, and diverse support personnel. \
The PCMDI mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and intercomparison of general circulation models (GCMs) \
that simulate the global climate. The need for innovative analysis of GCM climate simulations is apparent, \
as increasingly more complex models are developed, while the disagreements among these simulations and relative \
to climate observations remain significant and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements must be accounted \
for in a systematic fashion in order to confidently use GCMs for simulation of putative global climate change.
